I like reading Hacker News because it's a targeted community that doesn't want to get ruined by news that doesn't matter. Just checking the front page can give me an idea of what's going on in the world of tech/start ups/hacking, so I don't need to check a dozen RSS feeds in Google Reader. If something MAJOR (i.e. South Korea nukes North Korea or vice versa), it'll probably be on the front page too, so I can also figure out if anything important is going on in the world. I could care less about the amount of political news that is analyzed day after day after day on the internet, TV, radio, etc. I care about what I'm interested in and not about which celeb is dating which.

This is a small python script by running which one can see only the top alticles(having points >= 100) from the first 5 pages of 'https://news.ycombinator.com/news' without going to the website to find the top rated articles manually. You just wake up in the morning and run this small piece code if you're connected to the Internet(off course!) to get a glimpse of what's hot!
The program will generate a .csv file consisting of 3 columns, namely: 'Title', 'Link', 'Points' as the output and the records in the .csv file will be sorted descendingly with respect to the individual points(votes).

N.B - There's a lot of scope for modifications to this implementation, especially for handling errors. So, any changes are welcome.
